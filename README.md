# Character-Recognition-with-R-Moments-and-Testing-with-kNN
The project report explains what character recognition is, how it is implemented, how it is encoded and tested on python. The project explains (blob_coloring_8_connected method) how to distinguish the characters in an image (with coloring), how to calculate the coordinates of these separated characters and get a black square background from these coordinates and explains how to get the moments of the characters in (hu, r, zernike). After these steps, the moments are added to a dataset and gui interface that we have designed, and individually train characters and tests for recognition quality.
